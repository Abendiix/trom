## Software that made Trom possible
- Trom was developed on a computer running [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
- Trom's visual assets were made with [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite). Logos, game/previews images and not game-related art/images were made with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
- Trom's sound assets (the trumpet's sound) were made from a single audio file from [VSCO 2](https://github.com/sgossner/VSCO-2-CE) ([Sum_SHTrumpet_stac_F4_v3_rr1.wav](https://github.com/sgossner/VSCO-2-CE/blob/master/Brass/Trumpet/stac/Sum_SHTrumpet_stac_F4_v3_rr1.wav)) that was then modified with [LMMS](https://lmms.io/)'s AudioFileProcessor.
- The code, compilation, exports and the game as a whole was made with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

## Description and game images
In this small game you can play the sound of a trumpet, where with each sound play, the game will display randomly colored notes near the trumpet. You can also try to guess which note is being played to test your hearing skills.

## Modes and functionalities
Trom has 2 available modes right now:
- In the first mode, anyone can make the trumpet sound while increasing a counter of how many times the trumpet has been played.
- In the second mode, anyone can try and guess which of the trumpet's note has been played. The left counter increases with each correct guessed until a wrongly guessed note and the right counter serves as a record of the most guesses made without failing (it will update if the left counter surpases the last record).

Trom has a configuration menu where anyone can adjust the device vibration (if the device has a vibration motor, mostly for phones) and change between Tap&Hold mode or classic tap mode. Below this options, anyone can check Trom's credits.

### Tap&Hold
Tap&Hold is a new approach to game playability and menu navigation where anyone can fully experience games and applications with a single input. This method/system came to life while developing Trom and others projects that have yet not released as a way to optimize any project's accessibility as it enables any game/app to be fully navigable with just one input.

<br>I want to push this method forward, improve it and make it a standard for as much projects as I can. This way, anyone will be able to enjoy games and apps with just the tap and hold of a button or any other input.

<br>In Trom anyone can choose Tap&Hold from the settings menu and navigate the game's menu since all of Trom is controlled with the shown user interface. Tapping the screen, space bar or left-button on the mouse will make the game navigate across the available options on the user interface. Holding any of the latter will show an animation that fills the selected option. If the animation is cancelled the selected option will not occur while finishing will play the action.

<br>
I'm still experimenting with Tap&Hold and I'm more than happy to hear any kind of feedback and improvements. You are more than welcome to change any of it to your liking downloading the source code and project!
